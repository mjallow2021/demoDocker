Docker was created in 2013 by Solomon Hykes and is now maintained by a company of the same name. It is a type of containerization technology which enables applications to be packaged as a set of easily deployable components. This makes it easy to deploy applications in a cloud-native environment, as they can be quickly and easily moved between different cloud infrastructure. Docker is one of the most popular containerization technologies in the market, with a market share of around 50%. It is used and endorsed by major companies like Microsoft, Google, AWS, IBM, and Red Hat.
